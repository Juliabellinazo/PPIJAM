    <h1>Kitana's Story</h1>
   
    <br>

<p>Kitana grew up dutifully loyal to Shao Kahn, whom she believed to be her true father. She was raised to be one of Shao Kahn's personal assassins, alongside her good friend Jade and her evil "sister" Mileena. Since she was a child, Princess Kitana did not understand why Mileena wore that veil, even during the sparring sessions at the Wu Shi Academy where she learned martial arts from master Bo' Rai Cho, when they grew up they served together as assassins in Kahn's Guard. Upon learning the truth about her past, she continued to feign loyalty to Kahn while planning and waiting for the right moment to openly turn against him. She was adopted by Kahn to strengthen his claims to the throne of Edenia after he killed King Jerrod, and married Jerrod's wife, Queen Sindel, who were Kitana's parents. Kahn later instructed his sorcerer and Earthrealm tournament fighter, Shang Tsung, to create a twin sister for Kitana; the monstrous Mileena, who was actually an evil clone of Kitana. Kitana's chance finally came during Mortal Kombat II, when Shao Kahn and Shang Tsung lured Earth's heroes to Outworld. Kitana entered the tournament, but secretly began contacting one of Earth's heroes (presumably Liu Kang) in an attempt to help them defeat Kahn. However, Kitana's efforts were discovered by Mileena. Mileena attacked her traitorous "sister", forcing Kitana to defend herself. Kitana defeated and killed Mileena, and in doing so, revealed that she was no longer loyal to Shao Kahn.</p>

    <h1>Curiosities</h1>
    <br>
   <p> During the development of Kitana in Mortal Kombat II, her name was to be Kitsune (狐), which is Japanese for 'fox'. She ws also to be the daughtaer of Shang Lao. Ed Boon described Kitana and Mileena as the female equivalents of Scorpion and Sub-Zero, the two most iconic male characters in the series with a fierce rivalry of their own. Speaking in 2009, Boon said that Kitana has become one of the most recognizable characters in Mortal Kombat, alongside Scorpion, Sub-Zero and the series' official protagonist, Liu Kang. Kitana's iconic "Kiss of Death" Fatality was inspired by the disappearance of the villain Mr. Big (Dr. Kananga) in the 1973 James Bond film Live and Let Die, adding that it was his favorite finishing move from MKII and one of the best examples of his attempt to combine violent and humorous elements in the game. </p>

    <h1>History of Mortal Kombat</h1>
    <br>
    <p>is a popular fighting game series created by Midway Games, which in turn spawned a number of related media. It is particularly known for its digitized sprites (which set it apart from the hand-drawn sprites of its contemporaries) and its mix of gory and brutal action; its graphical Fatality death moves contributed to the founding of the ESRB. The original Mortal Kombat was developed as a reaction to Capcom's popular fighting game Street Fighter II, featuring simpler controls and digitized graphics. The original idea for Mortal Kombat was conceived in 1989 along with the game's plot and content, but it was not released in arcades (and game systems) until 1991. Some argue that the game's graphic violence was gratuitous and was only included to generate a public outcry and controversy that would generate publicity for the game. Although highly controversial, the game's mix of realism and violence propelled Mortal Kombat to widespread and historic acclaim. The new Mortal Kombat movie was widely released in theaters and streaming on HBO Max on April 23, 2021.
